Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 

Hi!

I'm a fifth year master's student. I studied applied math as an undergraduate. I'm from Northampton, Massachusetts,
about a 2 hour drive from here. Favorite food is a tough one. I really really like oatmeal, which feels like a weird favorite food, but I guess that's what I'm going with. I'm in Providence for the year, so even though this class is online I still feel like I'm at Brown.
